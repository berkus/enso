## Warning ##
The Enso Project has not yet matured to the point where it is suitable for use in a working environment.

## Downloading ##
Pre-compiled binaries/packages are not yet available for non-technical end users.

Instructions for installing and running from the source are available at the [README](README.md).

Windows users can still download the binary package of Commercial Enso at [The Humanized Website](http://www.humanized.com/enso/).  However, please note that development has ceased on Commercial Enso.

## Using Enso ##
Enso is activated by the Caps Lock key.  Just hold down the Caps Lock key and type in an [Enso command](Commands.md) for example, "open firefox" or "define proclivity".  Release the Caps Lock key and your command will execute!
