To build a single-file Enso executable, run scripts/linux-glick/builder
It builds for the arch that you're currently on. Later this will be changed
 so that it can build for any Linux arch.
header.a is arch-specific; you get it by doing "make" in a glick-0.2 folder.
I've built separate versions for x86_64 and i686 and checked them into the repos.
Future plans: allow builder to take an architecture option so it can build for
 arches other than the one you're on (so one script can build binaries for all 
 arches)
