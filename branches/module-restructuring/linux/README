This is a Linux (could possibly work on *BSD or any platform for decent enough
gtk/cairo support) backend for Enso (http://www.humanized.com/).

It currently depends on:
    * python - only 2.5 has been tested so far, but could possibly work on 2.4
    * python-cairo
    * python-gobject
    * python-gtk2
    * python-xlib - 0.13 or above is highly advised

Having the xset program is optionnal, though it'll prevent bad key-repeat
problems which could completely break the input handling (by constantly
enabling/disabling Enso while holding the QuasiMode trigger key).

A composited environment, using for instance Compiz, KWin4, Metacity's
or xfwin4's compositor or xcompmgr, isn't mandatory, though highly advised
since proper blending will only be available with it.
