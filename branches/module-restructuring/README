Enso Readme
===========

In order to build and run Enso, you'll first need to set up a
platform-specific backend.

At present, there's only one such backend, for Mac OS X.  It's located
in the 'osx' directory; for setup instructions, please see
'osx/README'.

Once that's done, you'll have to set up and run Enso itself.  You can
find information on how to do this in 'core/README'.

Good luck!
