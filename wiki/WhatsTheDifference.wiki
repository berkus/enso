#The version of Enso downloadable from humanized.com vs. the version in this source code 

There's bound to be some confusion about the difference between the version of Enso we're giving away on our website and the version in the Google Code repository you're looking at now.  This page will attempt to clear that up.

Executive summary:  If you're a developer, you should work on the version in Google Code.  If you just want to use Enso on Windows, use the version on humanized.com.

= Frozen Enso =

The version of Enso that can be downloaded from http://www.humanized.com/enso is called the "Frozen" version.

Frozen Enso is a binary-only distribuion, based on a closed-source code-line kept on a private SVN server.  Development on it has ceased and will not be resumed.  Development-wise, it's a dead end; but it will continue to be the version that users download and install, and Humanized will continue to distribute and support it, until such time as development on the open source Enso code-line creates a suitable replacement.

Frozen Enso runs on Windows 2000, XP, and Vista only.  It uses a build process based on py2exe to bundle the Enso Python code, along with the Python interpreter, into a Windows executable file for distribution.

= Open-Source Enso =

The version of Enso in this repository is the new open-source version.  It's based on an all-new code tree, which is starting from scratch with a blank history.  Modules and chunks of code are rapidly being brought over from the old code and integrated.  Think of it as a combination of code migration and massive refactoring to remove all the cruft that Enso no longer needs.

Our immediate goal is to get open-source Enso to a point where we have the quasimode working (that is to say, you can hold Caps Lock, see a transparent message, and start typing a command into it) on all three platforms; and where we have at least the three commands *open*, *google*, and *calculate* working on all three platforms.

We're trying to take a very Pythonic approach to open-source Enso.  We will not be using py2exe or its equivalent to bundle up Enso into an executable binary; instead, we plan to distribute it as a Python package everywhere (so that you could in principle start Enso by going to a Python prompt and saying "import enso" followed by "enso.run()".)  Most available versions of Linux and OS X come with Python pre-installed.  That leaves Windows: We're going to have to find a way to get Python installed for Windows users of Enso, in the most humane way possible.  As a long-term goal, we'd like to help make Python a better platform for development of desktop Windows apps by making it easier to deploy the Python interpreter there.
