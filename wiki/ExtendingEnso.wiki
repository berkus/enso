#summary A description of ways to extend Enso

At present, the primary way to extend and customize Enso is through
the use of *plugins*.  A plugin is just a Python module or package with a single
function in it, `load()`, which takes no parameters, and is called
when the Enso quasimode is about to start itself.

The easiest way to add a plugin is through an `.ensorc` file, which
can be created in your home directory (if you're on Windows, this
directory is pointed to by the `HOME` environment variable).  This
file is actually just a Python script that's executed before any other
code when Enso starts up.  See the following example `.ensorc` for
more information.

{{{
import enso.config

enso.config.PLUGINS.extend(
    [ "mypackage.myplugin" ]
    )
