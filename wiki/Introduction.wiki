= Introduction =

The Enso Project is an extensible, graphical command-line interface.  Its goal is to provide a way of accessing whatever piece of functionality you need--be it calculating an expression, calling up a map, or performing a Google search--with a few, semantically meaningful keystrokes.  Enso is cross-platform and will run on OSX, Windows, Linux, as well as any other platform that supports python.

Enso was originally commercial software created and sold by Humanized, Inc. In early 2008, a new BSD-licensed open-source repository was created for Enso, and much of its code was inherited from the commercial version.
