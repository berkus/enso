"""
    Module for text layout.

    Text layout is accomplished by first laying-out the text one wants
    to render, and then rendering it.  Layout entities are
    heirarchically organied: the root layout element is the Document,
    which is made up of Blocks; Blocks are made up of Lines; and Lines
    are made up of Glyphs.

    The parameters used by this text layout interface is loosely based
    on CSS.  To fully understand this module's interface, consider
    reading the introduction to 'CSS Pocket Reference', 2nd edition.

    This system is fairly standard as far as text layout engines go;
    to fully understand its implementation, you should first
    understand the basics of font glyph conventions.  A great tutorial
    on this can be found here:
