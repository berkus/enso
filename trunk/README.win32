Enso Windows Readme
===================

In addition to the prerequisites outlined in the README, you need to
have the following set up:

  * Python 2.4 needs to be installed at C:\Python24.

  * SWIG, the Simple Wrapper Interface Generator, must be installed at
    C:\Swig.

  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2003

TODO: This README is far from complete, and the above prerequisites
may not be all that's required; we need to expand on this.
