Enso OS X Readme
================

To build the Enso OS X backend, you need:

  * Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)
    This operating system comes packaged with an appropriate version
    of Python, as well as a number of OS X-specific Python modules
    needed by the backend.  The backend may also use some features of
    OS X that are only available in OS X 10.5, but this has not been
    verified; as such, it may be possible to run the backend on
    an earlier, properly-configured version of OS X.

  * Apple XCode tools
    This is needed for the gcc toolchain.

  * SCons
    This open-source, python-based build tool can be found at
    http://www.scons.org.

  * cairo w/ experimental Quartz integration
    This can be obtained through fink or macports.  Make sure you
    provide the proper flags to enable the experimental Quartz
    backend.

To build the backend, run 'scons' from the root directory of the
source tree.

For the time being, to install the backend, you need to add the root
directory of the OS X backend source tree to your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.

Finally, in order for quasimodal keypresses to be properly detected on
OS X, you must enable access for assistive devices in the Universal
Access System Preferences.




Troubleshooting
===============

1. How do I install Scons?

Download the tarball from www.scons.org, and after unpacking it, cd into the scons
directory and do:
sudo python setup.py install 


2. I run Scons and get an error message like this:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/scons", line 160, in <module>
    import SCons.Script
ImportError: No module named SCons.Script

Solution: try adding the following line to your ~/.profile  file:

export SCONS_LIB_DIR=/Library/scons-0.97

(Change the path as apropriate if you're using a version of Scons newer than 0.97.)
Then restart your terminal session.
