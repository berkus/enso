Enso Readme
===========

For the time being, in order to use Enso, you need to add the root
directory of the Enso source tree to your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.

You'll also need to obtain, build, and install a platform-specific
Enso backend, such as enso_osx.

Aside from said backend and Python 2.4 or above, Enso currently has no
other dependencies.

No build step is currently required for Enso--it's all pure Python
source code.

To run Enso, just execute scripts/run_enso.py.
